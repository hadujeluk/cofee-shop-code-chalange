# Coffee Shop Code Challenge

## Overview

This project is designed to simulate a coffee shop system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. It involves creating three primary classes: `Customer`, `Coffee`, and `Order`. The relationships between these classes are modeled to reflect a coffee shop's operations.

## Project Structure

  - `__init__.py`
  - `customer.py` - Contains the `Customer` class.
  - `coffee.py` - Contains the `Coffee` class.
  - `order.py` - Contains the `Order` class.
- `tests/`
  - `test_customer.py` - Contains unit tests for the `Customer` class.
  - `test_coffee.py` - Contains unit tests for the `Coffee` class.
  - `test_order.py` - Contains unit tests for the `Order` class.
- `README.md` - This file.
- `.gitignore` - Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control.
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies (currently empty).
